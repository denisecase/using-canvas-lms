## Module 0

Module 0 is for all the syllabus and course required information. 
Having them mark "Done" on each page is a way to help students see critical information about required textbooks, course policies, prerequesities and more. 
Remaining modules are given just this Module 0 as a prereq - once all Module 0 pages have been reviewed and marked "Done", the full course is available.

Name activities by skill whereever possible.

Add "& Engage" in the name if interaction is required. 

Make most pages a discussion with at least a couple points. 

Students care most about assignments and it helps them encounter critical overview and lecture content pages.
